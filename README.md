## Overview 
This project is a replica of Instagram that mimics core functionalities like generating a user feed, liking/unliking posts, and adding new posts. The goal was to recreate a familiar social media experience using modern web development technologies.

## Features
**Dynamic Feed**
An API is used to generate and display an Instagram-like feed of user posts. 

**Like/Unlike Posts**:
Users can interact with posts by liking or unliking them, with real-time updates to the UI. 
**Create New Post**: Users can add new posts to the feed, simulating the core functionality of creating content. ## Technologies Used
